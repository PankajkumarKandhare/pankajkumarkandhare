            What can you expect with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>?</p>
        <p>
            In clinical trials, OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> intravitreal implants improved the vision
            of many patients. It&rsquo;s important to remember that each case of diabetic macular
            edema, retinal vein occlusion, or noninfectious uveitis affecting the back segment
            of the eye is unique. Your own results may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Talk with your doctor</strong><br />
            Your doctor will describe the injection procedure and answer any questions you may
            have. The information provided below is intended to provide a basic understanding
            of how an intravitreal injection of OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> is performed. Your retina
            doctor is specially trained in administering eye injections.

                An implant that fully dissolves
            </p>
            <p>
                The OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> implant is so tiny it can be injected in your doctor's office. 
                Each implant is already inside a special applicator that is needed to perform the 
                insertion. The implant will be injected into the vitreous humor inside your eye.
                This is known as an intravitreal injection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the eye, the implant is slowly dissolved by the vitreous gel that fills the
                eye, releasing medication. As the level of
                medication decreases over time, swelling or inflammation may affect your vision
                again. If this occurs, your doctor may recommend another OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>
                injection.
            </p>
        </div>

                    During the injection procedure</p>
                <p>
                    You will be awake during the procedure. Your doctor will follow steps that include
                    ensuring the surface of the eye is clean and numbing the surface of the eye to help
                    keep you comfortable. OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> is injected using a special applicator
                    device that&rsquo;s about the size of a pen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The applicator is designed to help your doctor deliver OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> to
                    the vitreous where the medication is needed. As the injection occurs, you may feel
                    some pressure. You may then hear a click when your doctor presses the button that
                    releases the OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> implant in your eye.

                Risks associated with intravitreal injections
            </p>
            <p>
                Injections into the vitreous in the eye, including those with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>,
                are associated with serious eye infection (endophthalmitis, pronounced <em>en-dof-thal-<strong>my</strong>-tis</em>),
                eye inflammation, increased eye pressure, and retinal detachments. Your eye doctor
                may monitor you regularly after the injection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of corticosteroids including OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> may produce posterior subcapsular
                cataracts, increased eye pressure, glaucoma, and may increase the establishment
                of secondary eye infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Let your doctor
                know if you have a history of ocular herpes simplex.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common side effects reported in patients for retinal vein occlusion and
                uveitis include: increased eye pressure, conjunctival blood spot, eye pain, eye
                redness, ocular hypertension, cataract, vitreous detachment, and headache.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common side effects reported in patients with diabetic macular edema include:
                cataract, increased eye pressure, conjunctival blood spot, reduced vision, inflammation
                of the conjunctiva, specks that float in the field of vision, swelling of the conjunctiva,
                dry eye, vitreous detachment, vitreous opacities, retinal aneurysm, foreign body
                sensation, corneal erosion, inflammation of the cornea, anterior chamber inflammation,
                retinal tear, drooping eyelid, high blood pressure, and bronchitis.
            </p>
            <p>
                After repeated injections with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>, a cataract may occur. If
                this occurs, your vision will decrease and you will need an operation to remove
                the cataract and restore your vision. You may develop increased eye pressure with
                OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> that will need to be managed with eye drops, and rarely,
                with surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the days following injection with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>, you may be at risk for potential complications including in particular,
                but not limited to, the development of serious eye infection or increased eye pressure.
                If your eye becomes red, sensitive to light, painful, or develops a change in vision,
                you should seek immediate care from your eye doctor. You may experience temporary
                visual blurring after receiving an injection and should not drive or use machinery
                until your vision has resolved.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are not the only risks associated with intravitreal injections. If you experience
                other side effects, you should immediately contact your eye doctor. Your Retina
                Specialist will discuss the possible risks with you before performing the injection.

                The OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> implant slowly dissolves, releasing medication. As the
                level of medication decreases over time, swelling or inflammation may affect your
                vision again. If this occurs, your doctor may recommend another OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>

                If you have diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or noninfectious
                posterior segment uveitis, talk to your doctor. He or she should be your main source
                of information about your condition. The OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> patient guides
                are intended to supplement the information you receive from your doctor to help
                you better understand your condition and treatment.

                <strong>What's in the OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> patient guides?</strong><br />
                The patient guides contain information about the eye, your condition, and the OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>
                intravitreal implant. These booklets can be used to help you, family, and friends
                understand your condition. They also contain a handy section for keeping track of
                your doctor's instructions.

                Injections into the vitreous in the eye, including those with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>, 
                are associated with serious eye infection (endophthalmitis), eye inflammation, increased

<strong>Patient Counseling Information</strong>
<p>
    After repeated injections with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>, a cataract may occur. If 
    this occurs, your vision will decrease and you will need an operation to remove 
    the cataract and restore your vision.You may develop increased eye pressure with 
    OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup> that will need to be managed with eye drops, and rarely, 
    with surgery.
</p>
<p>
    In the days following injection with OZURDEX<sup>&reg;</sup>, you may be at risk for potential 
    complications including in particular, but not limited to, the development of 
    serious eye infection or increased eye pressure. If your eye becomes red, sensitive 
    to light, painful, or develops a change in vision, you should seek immediate care 
    from your eye doctor. You may experience temporary visual blurring after receiving 
    an injection and should not drive or use machinery until your vision has resolved.
